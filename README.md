### About Sudoku -
Sudoku is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle, the objective is to fill a 9X9 grid 
with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3Ã—3 subgrids that compose the grid 
(also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle 
setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.


# Using OpenCv

Project involves the extraction of sudoku board from a image with the help of OpenCv-Python. I want
to build an automated system that detects the sudoku board from the image of the (taken by a 
camera placed at some particular position for this purpose). Then the board is divided acoordingly 
to get the small block image. A model has been trained on digit dataset of handwritten dataset
